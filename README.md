# image_slicer

An imagemagick script to take any image crop it to a square and divide it into nine equal parts for uploading mosaics to instagram.
Shove make_grid into your /usr/local/bin folder type the following from inside that folder.

`$ chmod 744 make_grid`

And then you can use it like this from anywhere.

`$ make_grid image.png`

It will spit out files called post_x.png where "x" is a number.
Upload them to your instagram feed in reverse numerical order and voila you have a mosaic.

Enjoy!
